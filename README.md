# bimo
Binary file description language inspired by [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) with some new key features:
* Support of both read and write operations
* Separate language for data description

BiMo is a compiler from DSL to target language that lets you read data from a stream, modify it and write back. Compiler produces sources for minimal runtime and structure declarations.
