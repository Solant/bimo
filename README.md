# Rebel
(<b>R</b>oughly <b>E</b>laborate <b>B</b>inary <b>E</b>xpression <b>L</b>anguage) is a binary file description language and a compiler inspired by [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) with some new key features:

* Support of both read and write operations
* Separate language for data description

It produces minimal output with no external dependencies, so you can use compiled sources with no hassle against build systems (I'm looking at you, CMake)

[Online demo (fully-fledged browser version)](https://bimo-online.netlify.com/)

## Supported languages
Core compiler is implemented with TypeScript, however, it can generate sources for any other language.

| Language | Package |
|----------|---------|
| TypeScript | [target-ts](https://github.com/Solant/rebel/tree/master/packages/target-ts) |
| Java | TBD |
| C++ | TBD |

Any new languages implementations are welcome :^]

## Installation
Rebel is split into multiple packages, so you can select how you want it to be installed:
1. CLI version
```
npm i @rebel-struct/core @rebel-struct/cli
```
2. Programmatic
```
npm i @rebel-struct/core
```

By default `core` won't have any language support, so you'll also need target package for your language, for example for TypeScript
```
npm i @rebel-struct/target-ts
```
3. Nah, I just need some sources and thats it

Compile sources with [online version](https://bimo-online.netlify.com/) and copy it to your project


## File structure description

### Structures
File contains several structure declarations in next format:
* simple
```
struct TwoNumbers {
  num1: i32;
  num2: i32;
}
```
* and default
```
default struct MainStructure {
  numbers: TwoNumbers;
}
```
exactly one default structure is required for a file, as it will be used to generate public `read` and `write` functions.

### Fields
Structures can define several fields in next format: `<fieldName>: <type>;`. All fields with the exception of dependant fields will be generated in output code, for example:
```
default struct MainStruct {
  myField: i32;
}
```
will generate this TypeScript code:
```
interface MainStruct {
  myField: i32;
}
readMainStruct(...) {
  let object = .....;
  object.myField = <read 32 bit value>
}
```

### Simple Types
| Rebel type | C++ type|
|-----------|--------|
| i8        | int8_t |
| i16       | int16_t|
| i32       | int32_t|
| i64       | int64_t|
| u8        |uint8_t |
| u16       |uint16_t|
| u32       |uint32_t|
| u64       |uint64_t|

### Arrays
Some binary data might require dynamic arrays support, for this case type `array` is available:
```
default struct ArrayStruct {
    length: i32 = lengthof(data);
    data: array<i32>(length);
}
```

`length: i32 = lengthof(data)` is computed property. It allows description of dynamic data that has dependencies on different fields.
This field won't be available for direct read/write operations, but will be properly handled during serialization/deserialization.

With `array<i32>(length)` you can define array with dynamic size of field `length`. Field will be read during deserialization, and written during serialization stage automatically.

This can also be used if binary data store size instead of length, for example:
```
default struct ArrayWithSizeStruct {
    size: i32 = lengthof(data)*4;
    data: array<i32>(size/4);
}
```
In this way `size` field will store size (in bytes) of 32-bit integer array `data` while preserving correct binary contents for serialization process.
